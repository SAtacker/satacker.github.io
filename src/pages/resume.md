## Education

### Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute Mumbai, India

```
BTech. in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering Aug. 2019 – Aug. 2023
```
## Experience

### CNCF and Linux Foundation Intern September 2021 – November 2021

```
WasmEdge Runtime Remote
```
- WasmEdge is a lightweight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud native, edge, and
    decentralized applications.
- It powers serverless apps, embedded functions, microservices, smart contracts, and IoT devices.
- Developed a C-Extension for the Python SDK that supports near native speeds.
- Developed unit-tests and established benchmarks for the C-Extension of Python SDK.
- Supported multiple operation modes of WasmEdge Runtime in C-Extension for Python-API.

### Google Summer of Code June 2021 – August 2021

```
BeagleBoard.org Remote
```
- Designed and implemented a dashboard using FTXUI to aid the low level configurations in linux and some specifics
    to beaglebone boards using Modern CPP
- Used userspace’s IOCTL calls, Sockets for adding routes and deleting them.
- Cross Compilation for ARM architecture using clang and gnu tool-chain and used build file generator CMake

### Munga Innovations March 2020 - June 2020

```
Embedded and AI intern Mumbai, India
```
- Developed a Image Classifier based on the Inception v3 for detection of unnecessary matter on Solar Panels, light
    enough to run on resource constrained systems.
- Integrated the CNN on Rasp. PI 4 with Espressif’s micro-controller ESP32 for the complete cleaning cycle of the
    cleaning bot.
- Designed a back-end for the above mentioned cleaning process on ESP32 with integration to firebase using esp-idf
    API for client side web interface.

## Projects

### DRV8305 Driver|C August 2021 – September 2021

- Texas Instruments’s DRV8305 has support for R/W of it’s Control and Status Registers.
- Implemented a driver for Espressif’s ESP32 to establish Communication over SPI with R/W to the mentioned
    registers
- Developed on top of freeRTOS and Esp-IDF tool-chain.

### PID Tuning GUI Plotter|Qt, Modern C++ January 2021 – March 2021

- Developed a Cross Platform Application to plot and tune the PID Control parameters for Wall-E Robot
- Used Boost ASIO for networking and Threads for concurrency, and Qt SIGNALS for internal Queue handling
- Automated builds and Added material UI for the appearance and extensive documentation for the same.

### Imitecio — Human Pose Estimation Based Application|Tensorflow 1.1x June 2020 – July 2020

- Human Pose estimation has been around for a while and inspiration was taken from the same to make a game
    based on it.
- Several CNN architectures along with various bottom-up and top-down approaches for devising the keypoints were
    studied and transfer learning on pre-trained models was accomplished.
- Used Tensorflow Lite’s Interpreter to get the keypoints from Google’s PoseNet Model and mapped the same using
    OpenCV over the frames.


## Responsibilities

### Society of Robotics and Automation 2019 – Present

```
Software Head VJTI, India
```
- Taught various robotics concepts including Motor Control using MCPWM unit on ESP32 for Self Balancing and
    Line Following Bot
- Mentored Juniors for the Eklavya Summer Mentorship Program for projects like Audio Noise Reduction using
    Machine Learning based approaches, TUI for Email Client, Audio Router using Espressf’s ESP32, etc.
- Taught Convolution in Computer Vision and various advanced Python Programming Concepts and Computer
    Vision Modules like OpenCV.

## Competitions

### Eyantra Robotics Competition by IIT-B|ROS Melodic, Python 2,Drone October 2020 – March 2021

- Successfully completed all the stages of Competition and Applied Control Systems on a UAV (Drone)
- Featured HAAR Cascade using OpenCV for detection of landing markers and Implemented path planning
    algorithms and obstacle avoidance

### SRA Auto Sim Competition|ROS Melodic, Python 2,Line Follower December 2020

- The competition consisted in implementing algorithm for Line Follower Bot and navigating through a series of
    puzzling areas which makes it much challenging.
- Implemented PID Controller for which we were awarded II Prize.
